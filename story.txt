On a brisk winter morning, Benny woke up excited wagging his tail. He ran to the window on his little corgi legs to watch the sno fall elegantly to the ground. He sat patiently watching the snow build up and cover the grass out front. It was his first time seeing snow after moving back to Wisconsin and could not wait any longer.

He walks out the house, and goes down the street to the neighbor's dog house to visit his girlfriend, May. He spend some time together with her. The dating has extra atomosphere in the snow weather.

However, their dating was disturbed by the dog when the dog several started barking loudly. The hostess of the house stopped walking with him and started taking care of the dog.
